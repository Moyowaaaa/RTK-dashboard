This Project was bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app). 
## TODO

+ ##### Implement some functional logic such as login and viewing stats from each user such as website visitors, total sales for the day, total profit, net income, revenue ...
+ ##### Consume a dummy API through its endpoints: 
  + [All Users](https://639a3f4b16b0fdad77584051.mockapi.io/api/v3/users)
  + [User Data by Id](https://639a3f4b16b0fdad77584051.mockapi.io/api/v3/users/:id )
  + [User Dashboard](https://639a3f4b16b0fdad77584051.mockapi.io/api/v3/users/:id/dashboard)


## Features 
+ Authentication system that checks for login credentials before allowing users access the dashboard

+ Dashboard that displays graphs based on data gotten from authenticated user

+ Mobile responsiveness to ensure that it is compatible with multiple screen sizes

## Tools and Technologies

The technologies I used to achieve my solution are:

+ Vercel for web hosting
